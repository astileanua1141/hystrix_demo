# Hystrix Demo
### Just having a look at Hystrix 

In summary Hystrix is designed to:
- Provide protection and control over failures and latency from services typically accessed over the network
- Stop cascading of failures resulting from some of the services being down
- Fail fast and rapidly recover
- Degrade gracefully where possible
- Real time monitoring and alerting of command center on failures
